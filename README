plexremote
----------

This is a very early alpha version, only for testing purposes. No bug reports until I release the first beta please :)

Requirements:
  - PHP5
  - cURL
  - plex (or xbmc) with enabled web server

Installation:
  - update sendcommand.php with your plex web server ip/port
  - open mobile Safari and browse to the URL of the remote
  - click the + and add a link on your home screen
  - use this home screen icon to launch the remote, it behaves like a native app
